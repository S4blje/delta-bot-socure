How to setup bot? Its easy, just download it, download python and type next command in console: https://github.com/n3ca/really-bad-bot.git
I would not recommend you to use this bot because u can make better by yourself but if you want it, take it. Also i dont know the owner, i just found to code, but anyways i think they use new code so enjoy it.
